# Advanced React and Redux

This is the code from the Advanced React course by Stephen Grider at
[Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux-tutorial/)

## Progress

Completed section 6 - Authentication Server

## Starting point

I have used a slightly different starting point for my 4 projects by
forking Stephen's ReduxSimpleStarter
[here](https://github.com/JulianNicholls/ReduxSimpleStarter).

It has the calls to the Google Maps API removed, the test_helper after the
testing section, and one or two files re-formatted.

## Auth Login / Signin

I have used Login/Logout instead of Signin/Signout consistently across the
Auth server and client, because I prefer the complete difference in words.
I have confused myself, and I have seen lecturers / co-workers confuse
themselves and me when there is the slip of the tongue between talking
about signin and signup. e.g.

* server authentication.signin -> authentication.login
* server router /signin, requireSignin -> /login, requireLogin

* client index /signin -> /login
* client index /signout -> /logout
* client Signin -> LoginForm
* client Signout -> Logout
* client actions signinUser, signoutUser -> loginUser, logoutUser
* ... and so on


## Git client

I have used Git at the command-line for almost 10 years.
Over that time, I have tried many different graphical shells for Git,
without finding one that was easier and nicer to use than the command-line
(in my view).

I have now found that [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com) is an excellent
Git shell and would advise using it to everyone.
